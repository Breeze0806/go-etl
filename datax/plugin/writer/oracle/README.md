# OracleWriter Plugin Documentation

## Quick Introduction

The OracleWriter plugin enables data writing to an Oracle database. Under the hood, OracleReader connects to a remote Oracle database using `github.com/godror/godror` and `database/sql`. Unlike other databases, Oracle's interaction protocol is not publicly available. Therefore, the Golang driver for Oracle is based on [ODPI-C](https://oracle.github.io/odpi/doc/installation.html) and requires [Oracle Instant Client](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/instant-client/downloads.html) for the connection. For instance, connecting to Oracle 11g requires version 12.x of the client.

## Implementation Principles

OracleReader connects to a remote Oracle database using Oracle Instant Client via `github.com/godror/godror`. It generates SQL statements for writing based on user-configured information and go-etl's custom data types from Reader. These statements are then sent to the remote Oracle database for execution.

OracleReader implements specific queries by invoking go-etl's custom `storage/database` DBWrapper, defined in the query process of `dbmswriter`. DBWrapper encapsulates numerous interfaces of `database/sql` and abstracts the database dialect, `Dialect`. In this case, Oracle uses the `Dialect` implementation from `storage/database/oracle`.

Based on your configured `writeMode`, it generates:

* `insert into...` (if there's a primary key/unique index conflict, the conflicting row won't be inserted).

Note that the insert method here is not the usual `storage/database` insert implementation but a specific Oracle approach. In this implementation, the query might be `insert into a(x,y,x) values(:1,:2,:3)`, where the args for x, y, and z are arrays consisting of column values.

## Functionality Description

### Configuration Example

Configuring a job to write data from memory to an Oracle database:


```json
{
    "job":{
        "content":[
            {
                 "writer":{
                    "name": "oraclewriter",
                    "parameter": {
                        "connection":  {
                            "url": "connectString=\"192.168.15.130:1521/xe\" heterogeneousPool=false standaloneConnection=true",
                            "table": {
                                "schema":"TEST",
                                "name":"DEST"
                            }
                        },
                        "username": "system",
                        "password": "oracle",
                        "writeMode": "insert",
                        "column": ["*"],
                        "preSql": ["create table a like b"],
                        "postSql": ["drop table a"],
                        "batchTimeout": "1s",
                        "batchSize":1000
                    }
                },
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
### Parameter Description

#### url

* Description: Mainly used to configure the connection information for the target database. The basic format for Oracle database connections is: `connectString="192.168.15.130:1521/xe" heterogeneousPool=false standaloneConnection=true`. The `connectString` represents the connection information for the Oracle database. If using a server name for the connection, please use `ip:port/servername` or `(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=ip)(PORT=port))(CONNECT_DATA=(SERVICE_NAME=servername)))`. If using a SID for the connection, use `(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=ip)(PORT=port))(CONNECT_DATA=(SID=sid)))`. This is similar to the connection configuration information in the [Godror User Guide](https://godror.github.io/godror/doc/contents.html), except that the username and password are extracted from the connection configuration for easier encryption in the future.
* Required: Yes
* Default: None

#### username

* Description: Mainly used to configure the Oracle database username.
* Required: Yes
* Default: None

#### password

* Description: Mainly used to configure the Oracle database password.
* Required: Yes
* Default: None

#### table

Describes the Oracle table information.

##### schema

* Description: Mainly used to configure the schema name of the Oracle table.
* Required: Yes
* Default: None

##### name

* Description: Mainly used to configure the table name of the Oracle table.
* Required: Yes
* Default: None

#### writeMode

* Description: Write mode. `insert` represents writing data using the `insert into` method.
* Required: No
* Default: insert

#### column

* Description: An array of column names from the configured table that need to be synchronized, described using JSON array notation. Users can use `*` to represent all columns by default, e.g., `["*"]`. Supports column pruning, which means you can select specific columns for insertion. Supports column reordering, which means columns can be inserted in a different order from the table schema.
* Required: Yes
* Default: None

#### batchTimeout

* Description: Mainly used to configure the timeout interval for each batch write operation. Format: number + unit. Units: s for seconds, ms for milliseconds, us for microseconds. If the timeout interval is exceeded, the data will be written directly. This parameter, along with `batchSize`, helps adjust write performance.
* Required: No
* Default: 1s

#### batchSize

* Description: Mainly used to configure the batch write size. If the size is exceeded, the data will be written directly. This parameter, along with `batchTimeout`, helps adjust write performance.
* Required: No
* Default: 1000

#### preSql

* Description: Mainly used for SQL statement groups executed before writing data. Do not use select statements as they will cause errors.
* Required: No
* Default: None

#### postSql

* Description: Mainly used for SQL statement groups executed after writing data. Do not use select statements as they will cause errors.
* Required: No
* Default: None

## FAQ

1. How to configure Oracle's Oracle Instant Client?

Here's an example:

* On Linux, set the environment variable like this: `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/oracle/instantclient_21_1:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. Also, note that you need to install `libaio`.
* On Windows, update the system path like this: `set path=%path%;%GOPATH%\oracle\instantclient_21_1`.
Note: Oracle Instant Client 19 is no longer supported on Windows 7.
